# Harshil Shah's Sudoku Solver:

Hey everyone! You chose to read about my Sudoku Solver repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

Learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is necessary in becoming a better programmer. Learning Java, I took it upon myself to apply OOP concepts/principles to a 

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- React.js for the front-end interface (this includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- Google Firebase for storing contact queries
- Other CSS libraries (Bootstrap for example)

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

This was essentially my first web-based application. Although I created a portfolio web application before, it was a much simpler one and only used HTML and CSS. As such, there were quite a few problems/challenges I faced:

1: Learning React.js was a big learning curve. I had no idea what I was getting into, and therefore, was watching a lot of YT tutorials, reading documentation, etc. Eventually, I was able to grasp React concepts (functional/classical components, hooks, client-side routing, array manipulation on a web based application, and more!).  

2: Making my website responsive. Although not difficult (more tedious), it was definitely not as easy as I had expected. Eventually, I used @media targeting to solve this issue.

# What's next?:

I have learned quite a lot just from making this web application. I hope to continuously update my information and improve features as I learn more about web development. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
